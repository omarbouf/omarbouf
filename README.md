### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ About me: ... My name is omar boufeloussen, i am a machine learning engineer  | Passionate about AI, ML, DL | Enthusiastic learner.     i love the process of collecting , cleansing and analyzing data. my focus is to use data to design, develop machine learning models and use my software skills to deploy those models into production to solve a business problem or automate a process.

- âš¡ My philosophy: ... I'm committed to understand the world around me in the simplest way. Thus, I like to understand complex concepts intuitively, so I can explain them clearly, before jumping into the formal way of grasping an idea. So thatâ€™s why I love data science, its where deeply understanding of basic ideas matter and transforming those ideas to actions is what can make a huge difference on making decisions and process automating. So my passion for machine learning & deep learning and big data is driven by my passion to design, develop data oriented applications by making use of the most suitable approaches to solve a problem, concentrating on problem understanding and solving rather than being tools oriented.
